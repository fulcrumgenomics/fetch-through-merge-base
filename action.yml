inputs:
  base-ref:

    required: false
    description: >
      The base ref or target branch in the workflow run.  If empty or 
      not defined, the `fallback-base-ref` input ref will be used.
  head-ref:
    default: ${{ github.head_ref }}
    required: false
    description: >
      The head ref or source branch in the workflow run.  If empty or
      not defined, the `fallback-head-ref` input ref will be used.
  fallback-base-ref:
    default: "main"
    required: false
    description: >
      The base ref to use when `base-ref` is empty or not defined.  For
      example, when using `github.base_ref` for `base-ref`, and the
      workflow is not a `pull_request` or `pull_request_target`, then
      the `base-ref` is not defined, so this ref will be used.

    default: ${{ github.sha }}

    description: >
      The number of commits to increase from the tip of each base and ref
      history when `git merge-base` fails to find the common ancestor of 
      the two commits.
  fail-after:
    default: 100
    required: false
    description: >
      The number of attempts to deepen before the action fails.
  working-directory:
    default: ./
    required: false
    description: >
      The working directory to switch to when runnign this action.
  fallback-fetch-all:
    default: false
    required: false
    description: >
      True to fetch all commits if number of attempts to deepen reaches 
      its limit, false to fail the action.
